# MIS-Godot
## Multiplayer implementation system for Godot version 2.1.4 and 3.0

### Description:

#### MIS-Godot is a graphical orientated server implementation system for the Godot game engine.
#### The main focus of this software is to allow user customization to match their specific game, without having to manually code the server. 
####
#### The software is to be used after the singleplayer game has been created, so the software can read the game and apply changes based on the users input. 
#### The motivation of this project, is school related, but also personal interest, as it has been an idea that i've had for a long time.
